          Earthquakes always strike without warning, so preparedness is the best protection.
          Knowing what to do before, during, and after an earthquake can lessen the risk of injury,
          prevent panic, and most importantly, save lives.

            <p>This guide provides practical steps to help you stay safe when an earthquake occurs.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Practice “Duck, Cover, and Hold”.</strong> This helps condition your body to respond automatically instead of panicking.</li>
              <li><strong>Save emergency contacts.</strong> This allows you to connect to help immediately without wasting time during crisis.</li>
              <li><strong>Know evacuation routes in your area.</strong> This ensures safer exits and helps you avoid dangerous areas where falling debris and collapsing structures may occur.</li>
              <li><strong>Prepare an emergency kit.</strong> This helps you survive independently when services are unavailable. Include essentials such as food, water, and first-aid supplies.</li>

              <li><strong>Remain calm.</strong> Staying calm helps you think rationally, avoid panic-driven decisions, and perform safety actions immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>If indoors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Duck, Cover, and Hold.</strong> Protect yourself from falling objects and debris.</li>
              <li><strong>Stay inside.</strong> During shaking, staying inside is often safer than running outside where debris may fall.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>If outdoors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Move to an open area.</strong> Go where falling debris and collapsing buildings are less likely; stay low and protect your head while moving.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Check yourself and others.</strong> Look for injuries, including minor cuts or bruises, and treat them quickly to prevent infection.</li>
              <li><strong>Expect aftershocks.</strong> They may happen minutes, days, or weeks later and can further damage weakened structures.</li>
              <li><strong>Inspect surroundings.</strong> Watch for hazards such as gas leaks, fire, or exposed wires that can cause additional danger.</li>
              <li><strong>Stay alert.</strong> Follow official announcements and guidance from local authorities and trusted sources. Avoid unverified information that can cause unnecessary panic.</li>
